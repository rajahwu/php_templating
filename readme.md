```

This structure assumes you are using Symfony for the PHP backend, but you can adapt it to other PHP frameworks or plain PHP as needed. Key components include:

* public/: This is your web root where the entry point (index.php)  resides. Static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images go here.

* src/: Contains PHP source code for your application. Doctrine ORM entities, controllers, services, and other backend logic are organized here.

* templates/: Twig templates for rendering HTML views.

* public/assets/js/src/: TypeScript source files for your client-side scripts. You can use Webpack to bundle and compile TypeScript into JavaScript for the browser.

* tests/: PHPUnit test cases for testing your PHP code.

* var/: Directory for temporary files generated by the application, like logs and caches.

* translations/: Translation files if you plan to internationalize your application.

* config/: Configuration files for the application.

* bin/: Executable scripts, such as Symfony Console commands.

* vendor/: Composer dependencies are installed here.

* .gitignore: Gitignore file to specify which files and directories should be excluded from version control.

* composer.json: Composer configuration for PHP dependencies.

* composer.lock: Lock file generated by Composer to ensure consistent dependencies across environments.

* webpack.config.js and tsconfig.json: Configuration files for Webpack and TypeScript, respectively.

This structure provides a good starting point, and you can adjust it as your project grows and specific requirements arise.
